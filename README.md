# Open Source and Open Standards

This is a repository with blogs about various experiences I've had working with Open Source and Open Standards.
The target context will be with respect to projects I've been involved with but the hope is that any info here 
is applicable for other instances where open source and open standards are involved.

Naturally these are my own experiences and perspectives so am open to all comments and better ways to do things.

Lastly as with all things, knowledge and approaches always evolve over time so some of the steps and retries
and refinements will also be covered.

As topics are written they will be added here. The first being some notes on "starting out".
